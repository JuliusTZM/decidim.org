	<p class="subtext editable">Decidim is more than a digital platform, it is a Free/Open project and infrastructure for participatory democracy.</p>
	<p class="subtext editable">Decidim involves code, documentation, design, training courses, legal frameworks, innovative practices, collaborative interfaces, development, user and facilitation communities, and a common vision.</p>
	<p class="subtext editable">Decidim helps society self-organize democratically at every scale: it enables citizens, organizations and public institutions (in districts, cities, regions, and beyond) to co-produce strategic planning, run participatory budgeting, construct multitudinous deliberation processes and enact distributed decision-making.</p>
