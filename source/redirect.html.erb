<%#
 REASON OF THIS REDIRECT PAGE:
 When sending a form, Netlify returns the designated feedback page
 with a <script> tag in the <head> including the form answers, which
 pushes the <meta charset="utf-8"> down and creates encoding issues
 in non-English pages. This redirect page helps avoiding the default
 Netlify behavoiur by loading a new page instead, since we don't
 need to recover the previous sent data.

 Fallback content is also presented in this page in case redirection
 fails for some reason.
