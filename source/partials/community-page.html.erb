        <p>You can create debates about the future of Decidim or propose new features or improvements. Proposals can receive support and comments, to show, for example, the interest they arouse in the community and value their development. Proposals that have a sponsor (such as a city council or any other entity), responsible for seeking and providing the necessary resources to carry out their development, will be useful for the project.</p>
