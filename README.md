# Decidim

This is a work in progress of the future web for Decidim project, the participatory democracy framework. 

Based on Hydra, a site template initially made for Jekyll, we've migrated it to Middleman. Browse through a [live demo](https://proud-alligator.cloudvent.net/). 

Hydra was made by [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com/), the Cloud CMS for Jekyll.
